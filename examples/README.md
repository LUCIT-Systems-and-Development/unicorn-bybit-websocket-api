# UNICORN Bybit WebSocket API - Examples
Here you will find best practice examples for the use of the UNICORN Bybit WebSocket API.

For each example you will find a `README.md` and a `requirements.txt` to install any dependencies. The respective `*.py` 
file is to download and start, if an example does not work, we are happy about a 
[patch](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-bybit-websocket-api/fork) or a message via
